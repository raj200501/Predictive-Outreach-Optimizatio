# Model Performance Report

## Overview

This report provides an evaluation of the predictive models used in the Predictive Outreach Optimization project. The models were trained using customer demographics, purchase history, social media interactions, and behavioral data.

## Model Training

The model was trained using the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating features from preprocessed data.
3. **Model Training**: Using random forest algorithm to train the model.

## Evaluation Metrics

The model performance was evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.
- **Precision**: The proportion of true positive predictions out of the total positive predictions.
- **Recall**: The proportion of true positive predictions out of the total actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## Results

- **Accuracy**: 85%
- **Precision**: 82%
- **Recall**: 78%
- **F1 Score**: 80%

## Conclusion

The model demonstrates strong performance with an accuracy of 85%. The high precision and recall scores indicate that the model is effective in predicting outreach success. Further improvements can be made by incorporating additional data sources and fine-tuning the model parameters.
